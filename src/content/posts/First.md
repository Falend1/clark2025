# Here are some of my thoughts and summaries

## The fruit business is very difficult to do at the moment. I worked at home for about half a month, getting up early and working late every day, but my business was sluggish. It happened that my uncle would also come during the Chinese New Year this year, so I began to think about how to make it bigger and stronger.
## However, due to the different concepts of the two, they couldn't think of a way to do things together, so this discussion ended hastily. Worried, how can you become a big business? Is it the continuous expansion of stores and the eventual formation of chain stores? Or go to a place with more foot traffic to open a bigger fruit supermarket? I'm not an expert in this either, so I'm left to no date in between. 
## After all, now people's living standards are improving at the same time, and they are reluctant to spend money. Hey, it's not up to us to decide whether the price is high or not.
## My father was worried, not only in the fruit business, but also in my brother's internship place, although my internship place does not have to worry, but who doesn't want to find a high-paying job? Therefore, I was going to go to Beijing to try it out to see if I could stay and work in Beijing, and by the way, find a high-paying job to maintain my living standards and support my family. 
## Success or not, all hope is pinned on me, I am also facing the situation of looking for a job immediately, this year is also a time to get results in the graduate school entrance examination, but I am not very sure of my graduate school results, the national line should not be very hopeful. It's false to say that you don't regret it, but what's the use of regretting? 
## Go for it! I wish I had worked harder, but now I realize how important the professional knowledge I learned in school is. That's where the responsibility lies.

### That's what I documented about my life, and although it was a bit incomplete, I tried my best to write down everything I could think of. So be it!
